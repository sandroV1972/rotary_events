# ROTARY EVENTS

This project started as a event managing web application for local Rotary clubs (started in Italy). It can be adapted to have any service club use it to invite their members to event and get a response via email in order to get automatically a count of participants (members and guests).

I would like to expand the capabilities to:

- have a sort of SET UP page so that the system is insitalised with proper graphics, member lists etc..
- improve graphics and functionalties
- receive any suggestion for functionalities and upgrades
